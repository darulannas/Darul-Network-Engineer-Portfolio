**1. Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the initial configuration steps for enabling internet access on a MikroTik router.
The configuration covers basic setup such as system identity, IP addressing, NAT masquerade, DNS settings, and route configuration.
This is part of my MTCNA learning practice, reflecting real-world setups I have implemented in office environments.

**4. Verification**

**5. Key Learning Points**
- Understood the purpose of default routing for internet access.
- Practiced creating NAT rules using masquerade.
- Learned how DNS and DHCP clients are used in RouterOS.
- Verified connectivity using ping and traceroute.
- Applied practical concepts from MTCNA curriculum in a real environment.

**6. Tools Used**
- MikroTik RouterOS v6
- WinBox (for GUI configuration)
- VirtualBox + CHR (optional if simulated)

**7. Author Notes**
